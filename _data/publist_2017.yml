- title: Designing lead-free antiferroelectrics for energy storage
  image: BNFO_AFE.jpg
  description: "The BRFO system is antiferroelectric (AFE) with relatively large composition of rare earth, and it is predicted to be very promising for high-power energy storage. Additionally, a simple model is derived to describe the energy density and efficiency of a general AFE material, providing a framework to assess the effect on the storage properties of variations in doping, electric field magnitude and direction, epitaxial strain, temperature, etc., which can facilitate future search of antiferroelectric materials for energy storage."

- title: Intrinsic polarization switching mechanisms in BiFeO3
  image: T-BFO_switch.png
  description: "The polarization switching mechanisms in intrinsic BFO is found to be homogeneous in the rhombohedral phase, for which the polarization is strongly coupled to oxygen octahedral tiltings. On the other hand, in the super-tetragonal phase the switching mechanism changes with increasing electric field, which can be explained by the field dependence of the switching barriers as well as the hierarchy of these barriers between different switching processes."

- title: Learning through ferroelectric domain dynamics in solid-state synapses
  image: stdp.png
  description: "The inhomogeneous switching can lead to memristive behavior when it is used in ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ). In this work we report spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) from BFO-based FTJs. The STDP behavior relies on the change of resistance states (memristor), which originates from the intrinsic inhomogeneous polarization switching. Unsupervised learning of pattern recognition is further demonstrated."
